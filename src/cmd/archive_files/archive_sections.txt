This file contains the archive sections.
Each line including the first holds a section name that is archived.
For eg:
bosm
oasis
This will indicate 2 sections that are archived and Archive-BOT will look for them.
Note:
1. Do not leave any blank line.
2. Names must be what you want users to enter to access archive. For eg: +bosm will correspond to BOSM archive. For that a line bosm should be there in this file.
3. Names are case sensitive.
4. Order does not matter.

Example file:-
bosm
oasis
